    This book will literally change the way you think about your next meal. Food psychologist Brian Wansink revolutionizes our awareness of how much, what, and why we’re eating—often without realizing it. His findings will astound you.

    • Can the size of your plate really influence your appetite?
    • Why do you eat more when you dine with friends?
    • What “hidden persuaders” are used by restaurants and supermarkets to get us to overeat?
    • How does music or the color of the room influence how much—and how fast—we eat?
    • How can we “mindlessly” lose—instead of gain—up to twenty pounds in the coming year?

    Starting today, you can make more mindful, enjoyable, and healthy choices at the dinner table, in the supermarket, at the office—wherever you satisfy your appetite.

    Understanding why we eat too much is a useful tool. Knowledge however is rarely enough. A strict diet is very hard to follow and sets you up for failure. Again. The author's point is that we don't monitor every calorie. We can't. Goodies Bandit makes it easy to see with frictionless tracking via photos and accountability for encouragement and support.
